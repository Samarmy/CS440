    "Description: The Towers of Hanoi Puzzle is a puzzle involving three stacks and three objects with the values 1, 2, and 3. The game starts with all objects stacked on the first stack in order from least to greatest (1, 2, 3) and the other two stacks are empty. You can then move the top of any stack to a different stack as long as the object being moved has a value less then the top of the stack it is being moved to (or the stack is empty). The goal of the game is to have the first two stacks empty and the third stack hold all of the objects in the order (1, 2, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations: It seems like a pretty straight-forward game to win for a human. The optimal path to win  only takes 7 moves and it's pretty easy to figure out. On the other hand its seemed more difficult for an algorithm to solve because in the beggining the only state it knows is a good move is the goal state and all the other states have the same weight of 1. So the algorithm has to run through the game multiple times to figure out which moves have the best weight so it can then find the optimal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficulties: I had some trouble with copying the data structure of 3 lists inside one list until I looked up the copy.deepcopy method. I was a little confused why we implemented the makeMove as a two index list (from stack a, to stack b) and not as the future state (i.e. [[1, 2, 3], [] ,[]] &rightarrow; [[2, 3], [], [1]]). But overall the problem seemed simple and easy to implement."
